# Blueberry-GUI
A GUI application for ordering blueberries and/or scheduling a date to pick blueberries!
by: Zach Richards
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This GUI application is simply a program I am putting together for my college class project.
However, the beneficial side effect of creating this program is that I actually live on a 
U-pick blueberry farm! At first, i was skeptical that this program would even begin to work.
However, as I continue to develop my GUI application, I'm seeing at how this can really be 
beneficial for my family's farm! Hopefully, once the project is completed, I can continue to 
work on this as a general application for our farm rather than let it catch dust.

Any and all support is appreciated!

Sincerely,
Zach R.
